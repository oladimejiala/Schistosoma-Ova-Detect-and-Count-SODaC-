# Schistosoma-Ova-Detect-and-Count (SODAC) Model.
This is a repository of a Deep Learning Model with the aim of screen urine and stool samples for Schistosoma parasite ova collected from schistosomiasis endemic communities in order to determine the prevalence and Intensity of Schistosomiasis and work towards achieving the WHO NTDs Roadmap 2030.
This model is been trained by diverse pictures of Schistosoma ova species. however it's still in development for finetuning and to create a robust database and make accurate conclusion especially when used on the field for diagnosis of schistosomiasis.
